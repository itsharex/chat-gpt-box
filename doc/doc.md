## Register the API

### Openai Api

Since `Openai` does not support access in Chinese mainland, proxy access is required, 
which is not detailed in this documentã€‚

Before using the `Openai Api`, you need to prepare a credit or debit card in the United States, 
and you can also use a virtual credit card, but you need to support the `Openai` payment method.
If you do not bind a bank card after registering the `Openai API`, 
the speed and number of API requests will be greatly limited.

- Registered address: [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- `ApiKey` page: [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
    - Click on `Create new secret key` to generate the key.
    - Configure the generated key in the settings of `chat-gpt-box`.

### Gemini Api

Registered address: [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)

### Use of third-party proxy services

Since `Openai` does not support access from mainland China, 
you can use third-party proxy services such as [2233ai](https://2233.ai/) or [burn hair](https://burn.hair/).

### Local `Ollama` service

You can use the local service of [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), 
with the configuration method similar to `Openai` and other services, and it does not require an `ApiKey`.
